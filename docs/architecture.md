### Key Relationships

**User Model:**
- `hasMany(Recipe)` - User owns multiple recipes
- `hasMany(Like)` - User can like/dislike multiple items
- `morphMany(Notification, 'notifiable')` - User receives notifications (via Notifiable trait)
- `belongsToMany(Recipe, 'user_saved_recipes')` - User can save favorite recipes

**Recipe Model:**
- `belongsTo(User)` - Recipe belongs to one user (author)
- `hasMany(Ingredient)` - Recipe has multiple ingredients (ordered)
- `hasMany(RecipeStep)` - Recipe has multiple preparation steps (ordered by step_number)
- `morphMany(Like)` - Recipe can receive likes/dislikes
- `belongsToMany(User, 'user_saved_recipes')` - Recipe can be saved by multiple users

**Ingredient Model:**
- `belongsTo(Recipe)` - Ingredient belongs to one recipe
- Cascade delete: ingredients are deleted when recipe is deleted

**RecipeStep Model:**
- `belongsTo(Recipe)` - Step belongs to one recipe
- Touch behavior: updates recipe.updated_at when step is modified
- Cascade delete: steps are deleted when recipe is force deleted

**Like Model:**
- `belongsTo(User)` - Like belongs to one user
- `morphTo(likeable)` - Like can be attached to any model (currently Recipe)

**Notification Model:**
- `morphTo(notifiable)` - Notification belongs to notifiable entity (polymorphic, currently User)
- Uses Laravel's built-in notifications table schema
- Stores notification type (full class name) and JSON data payload

## Component Relationships

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User] -->|creates| B[Recipe]
    B -->|has many| C[Ingredient]
    B -->|has many| I[RecipeStep]
    A -->|creates| D[Like]
    D -->|can like| B
    A -->|saves| B

    B -->|status: private| E[Private Recipes]
    B -->|status: pending| F[Pending Approval]
    B -->|status: approved| G[Public Recipes]
    B -->|status: rejected| H[Rejected Recipes]

    F -->|admin approves| G
    F -->|admin rejects| H
    E -->|user submits| F
    H -->|user resubmits| F
```

## View Layer & Navigation

### Navigation System

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[layouts/navigation.blade.php] -->|role check| B{User Role?}
    B -->|admin| C[nav/admin.blade.php]
    B -->|user| D[nav/user.blade.php]
    C --> E[nav/search-bar.blade.php]
    D --> E

    C -->|includes| F[Admin Navigation Items]
    D -->|includes| G[User Navigation Items]

    F --> F1[Pending Recipes]
    F --> F2[Public Recipes Moderation]
    F --> F3[Users Management]
    F --> F4[Dashboard]

    G --> G1[Public Recipes]
    G --> G2[My Recipes]
    G --> G3[Create Recipe]
    G --> G4[Saved Recipes]
```

**Role-Based Navigation:**
- `layouts/navigation.blade.php` checks user role via `Auth::user()?->role === 'admin'`
- Conditionally renders `<x-nav.admin />` or `<x-nav.user />`
- Both components maintain identical styling and structure
- Alpine.js handles mobile menu toggling
- Responsive design: horizontal navigation (desktop), hamburger menu (mobile)

**Navigation Components:**
- `nav/user.blade.php` - Regular user navigation with recipe management links
- `nav/admin.blade.php` - Admin navigation with moderation and management links
- `nav/search-bar.blade.php` - Placeholder search component (disabled, awaiting implementation)

### Dashboard Browse View

The dashboard serves as the main landing page for authenticated users, displaying a paginated grid of public recipes.

**Route:** `/dashboard`
**Query:**
```php
Recipe::public()
    ->with(['user', 'likes'])
    ->withCount([
        'likes as likes_like_count' => fn($query) => $query->where('is_like', true),
        'likes as likes_dislike_count' => fn($query) => $query->where('is_like', false),
    ])
    ->orderBy('created_at', 'desc')
    ->paginate(15);
```

**Features:**
- Displays only approved recipes (`status = 'approved'`)
- Responsive grid layout (1 column mobile, 2 tablet, 3 desktop)
- Recipe cards with photo/placeholder, metadata, like/dislike ratios
- Pagination (15 recipes per page)
- Empty state with call-to-action when no public recipes exist
- Eager loading prevents N+1 queries

**Performance Optimization:**
- Eager loads `user` and `likes` relationships
- Pre-calculates like/dislike counts at database level via `withCount`
- Recipe model accessors use pre-calculated aggregates when available
- Single query for pagination count

## Business Logic

### Recipe Status Workflow

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> private: Recipe created
    private --> pending: submitForApproval()
    rejected --> pending: submitForApproval()
    pending --> approved: approve()
    pending --> rejected: reject(reason)
    pending --> private: withdraw()
    approved --> [*]: Published
    rejected --> [*]: Needs revision
```

**Status Transition Rules:**
- `private` → `pending`: User submits recipe for approval
- `rejected` → `pending`: User resubmits after making changes (rejection_reason cleared)
- `pending` → `approved`: Admin approves recipe
- `pending` → `rejected`: Admin rejects with reason
- `pending` → `private`: User withdraws submission

**Guard Clauses:**
- Cannot submit for approval from `pending` or `approved` status
- Cannot approve/reject unless status is `pending`
- Cannot withdraw unless status is `pending`

### Like/Dislike System

- YouTube-style like/dislike ratio
- Polymorphic design allows any model to be likeable
- Unique constraint: user can only like/dislike once per item
- Accessors calculate percentages:
  - `like_percentage`: rounds to 1 decimal (e.g., 66.7%)
  - `dislike_percentage`: rounds to 1 decimal (e.g., 33.3%)
- Handles edge case: returns 0% when no likes exist

### Spam Prevention System

**Server-Side Validation:**
- Custom validation rule: `HasApprovedRecipeOrNoPendingRecipe`
- Non-verified users limited to 1 pending recipe
- Users unlocked after first recipe approval
- Rejected recipes don't count toward limit
- Verified users bypass all spam prevention

**Client-Side Prevention (Pending Recipe Limit Notification):**
- Alpine.js intercepts form submission on recipe show page
- Hard block: prevents HTTP request when spam limit reached
- Modal displays pending recipe name with link to view it
- Query optimization: only fetches pending recipe data for non-verified users
- Backwards compatible: falls back to server validation if JavaScript disabled

**Implementation:**
```php
// RecipeController@show - queries pending recipe for non-verified users
$pendingRecipe = null;
if (auth()->check() && !auth()->user()->is_verified) {
    $pendingRecipe = auth()->user()->recipes()
        ->where('status', 'pending')
        ->first(['id', 'title']);
}
```

**Modal Flow:**
1. User with pending recipe clicks "Submit for Approval" on different recipe
2. Alpine.js checks if `pendingRecipe` data exists
3. If exists: dispatches modal event, prevents form submission
4. If null: allows normal form submission
5. Modal shows pending recipe name and "View Pending Recipe" link

### Notification System

**Pattern:** Laravel Notifications framework with database channel

**Notification Types:**
1. `RecipeApprovedNotification` - Sent when admin approves pending recipe
2. `RecipeRejectedNotification` - Sent when admin rejects pending recipe (includes rejection reason)
3. `RecipeDeletedNotification` - Sent when admin moderates/deletes approved recipe (includes deletion reason, persists recipe title)

**Notification Dispatch:**
- Direct dispatch within AdminRecipeController methods (approve, reject, moderate)
- `$user->notify(new NotificationClass(...))` pattern
- Notifications sent to recipe owner after admin action completes

**Notification Data Structure (JSON):**
```php
[
    'recipe_id' => int|null,           // null for deleted recipes
    'recipe_title' => string,          // persisted even after deletion
    'status' => 'approved'|'rejected'|'deleted',
    'message' => string,               // human-readable notification message
    'action_url' => string,            // context-aware navigation URL
    'rejection_reason' => string,      // only for rejected notifications
    'deletion_reason' => string,       // only for deleted notifications
]
```

**Context-Aware Navigation:**
- Approved recipe → redirects to recipe detail page (`recipes.show`)
- Rejected recipe → redirects to recipe edit page (`recipes.edit`)
- Deleted recipe → redirects to recipe create page (`recipes.create`)

**User Interface:**
- Navbar displays unread count badge (red badge, shows "9+" for 10+ notifications)
- Notifications menu item in dropdown with count indicator
- Dedicated notifications index page with chronological list (newest first)
- Notification cards show icon (✅/❌/🗑️), message, timestamp, rejection/deletion reason
- Unread notifications have blue left border and blue dot indicator
- Read notifications have 75% opacity
- "Mark All as Read" button for bulk updates

**Performance:**
- Unread count uses query builder `count()` (not collection count) for efficiency
- Notifications paginated (20 per page)
- Index on (notifiable_type, notifiable_id) for fast user notification queries

**Security:**
- Users can only view their own notifications (enforced via `$request->user()->notifications()`)
- Notification data contains no sensitive information

## Key Files

### Models

**app/Models/Recipe.php**
- Core recipe entity with comprehensive status workflow
- Scopes: `private()`, `pending()`, `approved()`, `rejected()`, `public()`
- Methods: `submitForApproval()`, `approve()`, `reject()`, `withdraw()`
- Accessors: `like_percentage`, `dislike_percentage`
- Soft deletes enabled

**app/Models/Ingredient.php**
- Simple ingredient model with recipe relationship
- Ordered by `order` field for user-defined sequence
- Cascade delete with recipe

**app/Models/RecipeStep.php**
- Preparation step model with recipe relationship
- Ordered by `step_number` field (1-based numbering)
- Touch behavior: updates parent recipe timestamp
- Cascade delete on recipe force delete
- Validation: min 1 step, max 25 steps per recipe

**app/Models/Like.php**
- Polymorphic like/dislike functionality
- Boolean `is_like` (true = like, false = dislike)
- Extensible to any model type

**app/Models/User.php**
- Extended with recipe relationships
- Role-based access (admin/user)
- Manages owned recipes and saved favorites
- Uses Notifiable trait for notifications (from Laravel Breeze)

### Migrations

**Database Schema Features:**
- Enums for status and difficulty (database-level validation)
- Composite indexes for efficient querying (status + user_id)
- Foreign key constraints with cascade deletes
- Soft deletes on recipes for data retention
- Polymorphic columns for extensible like system
- Pivot table for many-to-many saved recipes

### Factories

- Realistic test data generation
- State methods for different recipe statuses
- Domain-appropriate data (cuisine types, dietary tags, cooking units)

## Design Decisions

### Why SQLite?
- Simple setup for development and academic projects
- Portable database file
- Sufficient for application scope
- Easy testing with in-memory database

### Why Polymorphic Likes?
- Future extensibility (comments, reviews, user profiles can be liked)
- Single table for all like/dislike data
- Consistent API across different entities

### Why Soft Deletes on Recipes?
- Data retention for analytics
- Potential recovery of accidentally deleted recipes
- Preserves user history
- No impact on public-facing queries (automatically filtered)

### Why Status Enum in Database?
- Database-level validation prevents invalid states
- Type safety at schema level
- Better than string comparison
- Self-documenting schema

### Why Composite Index (status, user_id)?
- Efficient queries: "find my pending recipes"
- Common access pattern in user dashboard
- Minimal storage overhead
- Significant query performance improvement

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests (19 tests)
- Model relationships verified
